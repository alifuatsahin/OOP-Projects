## Installation

These projects only require Java. You can download project folders and run main files.

## Maze Game

The objective of this project is to learn the basics of object-oriented design principles,
Unified Modeling Language (UML) and design patterns. A small graphical Pac-Man
style Maze game is implemented. A Javadoc for the implementation is written and a UML class
diagram is created.
Keywords: Java, Object-oriented programming, Strategy Pattern, Singleton Pattern, Observer
Pattern, Decorator Pattern.

## Printer Queue

This project aims to implement multi-threaded applications
and synchronization using Java. A Multiple-Producer Multiple-Consumer (MPMC) Queue with different prioritization of elements is implemented. Then such a queue will be used
to simulate a printer room with multiple printers (consumers). And multiple print operations
submitted by multiple people; namely Students and Instructors. Instructor print jobs will have
precedence over the Student print jobs.
Keywords: Thread, MPMC Queue, Condition Variable, Atomic, Runnable.

## Stock Market

The objective of this project is to familiarize with the Java 8 streams. A token-based stock market that is used for assigning students to the technical electives on
CENG curriculum is implemented. In this project, Java 8 Stream API is used. Each student has a total of 100 tokens and the courses they can register for are found with this algorithm and happiness of each
student is calculated based on how many tokens they have spent and whether they can take the course or not.
Keywords: Java Streams, TATEC.
